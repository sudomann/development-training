    """Calculates how 'warm' the guess is.

    Args:
        secret_number: The target number the player is trying to guess.
        guess: The player's current guess.

    Returns:
        A string indicating the hint level:
            'Freezing': Far away from the target number
            'Warm':  Somewhat close 
            'Hot': Very close
            'Boiling!': The guess is correct
